# EGS Worship Team Schedule
> Simple overview for the EGS Worship Team Schedule 2021 / 2022

I did this project for 2 reasons.
1. I wanted to learn something new (Vue Composition API, Firebase integration, create my own css instead of using a Framework).
2. I was annoyed to lookup the excel sheet and see when I was scheduled next. I wanted easy access.
